## üöÄ Next Steps

### Required: Run Database Migration

Before using the doubles feature, you **must** run the migration:

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Run migration script
python migrate_add_doubles.py

# Expected output:
# ============================================================
# Database Migration: Add Doubles Support
# ============================================================
# [INFO] Starting database migration to add doubles support...
# [INFO] Adding game_type column...
# [SUCCESS] Added game_type column
# [INFO] Adding player3_netid column...
# [SUCCESS] Added player3_netid column
# [INFO] Adding player4_netid column...
# [SUCCESS] Added player4_netid column
# [SUCCESS] Database migration completed successfully!
```

### Testing the Feature

After migration, test the feature:

1. **Report a Singles Game**
   - Verify existing functionality still works
   - Check ELO updates correctly

2. **Report a Doubles Game**
   - Select "Doubles (2v2)" game type
   - Add partner and two opponents
   - Select winning team
   - Verify all 4 players' ELO updates

3. **View Game History**
   - Check singles games display correctly
   - Check doubles games show all 4 players
   - Verify game type badges appear

4. **Check Leaderboard**
   - Confirm win/loss counts include both game types
   - Verify unified ELO ranking

### Optional: Restart Application

If the application is currently running, restart it to load the new code:

```bash
# If using gunicorn
sudo rcctl restart gunicorn_chool

# Or if running in development
# Stop the Flask app and restart it
```

## üìä Implementation Details

### Design Decisions

1. **Unified ELO Rating**: Single rating for both game types maintains simplicity and allows for fair matchmaking across formats.

2. **Team Average Calculation**: Standard approach in team-based ELO systems. Provides reasonable balance between individual and team performance.

3. **Database Structure**: 
   - Player1 & Player2 = Team 1 (always populated)
   - Player3 & Player4 = Team 2 (only for doubles)
   - This structure keeps singles games simple while supporting doubles

4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing singles game functionality preserved. Existing games automatically marked as 'singles'.

### Files Modified

- `models.py` - Database models (67 lines added)
- `elo.py` - ELO calculations (56 lines added)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Tournaments**: Currently remain singles-only. Doubles tournaments not implemented.

2. **Migration Safety**: The migration is safe and idempotent. It can be run multiple times without issues.

3. **Data Integrity**: All existing games are preserved and marked as 'singles'.

4. **Testing Required**: After migration, thoroughly test both singles and doubles game reporting.

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If you need to remove doubles support:

```sql
-- WARNING: This deletes all doubles game data!
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN game_type;
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN player3_netid;
ALTER TABLE games DROP COLUMN player4_netid;
```

Then revert the code changes by checking out the previous git commit.

3. **Unified Ranking**: Single leaderboard for all players
