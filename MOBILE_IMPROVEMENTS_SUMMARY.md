## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Colors:
Update CSS custom properties in `:root` and dark mode media query:
```css
:root {
  --color-new: #value;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-new: #dark-value;
  }
}
```

### Adding New Animations:
Use CSS custom property for timing consistency:
```css
transition: all var(--transition-normal);
```

### Adding Mobile-Specific Styles:
Use established breakpoints:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Mobile styles */
}
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Card view for tables:** Only implemented for leaderboard tables. Game history tables still use horizontal scroll (as they have many columns).
2. **Auto-hiding header:** Only activates on mobile (‚â§768px) to preserve desktop UX.
3. **Scroll animations:** Disabled for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled.
4. **Safe area insets:** Only supported on iOS 11+ and modern browsers.

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were considered but not implemented as they would require more invasive changes:

1. **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Would require restructuring navigation
2. **Floating Action Button:** Would need route-based visibility logic
3. **Pull-to-Refresh:** Would require backend integration
4. **PWA Features:** Would need service worker and manifest setup
5. **Data Visualizations:** Would require charting library integration
6. **Share API:** Would need backend sharing functionality

---

## Conclusion

All planned non-invasive mobile UI/UX improvements have been successfully implemented. The changes are:

- ‚úÖ **Progressive enhancements** - don't break existing functionality
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - use modern APIs and best practices
- ‚úÖ **Accessible** - meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
